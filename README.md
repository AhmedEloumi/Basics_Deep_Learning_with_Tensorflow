Application on CNN(convolutional neural network) and RNN (recurrent neural network)

RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are two popular types of neural networks used in deep learning. While both are used for processing sequential data, they differ in their architecture and applications.

RNNs are designed to handle sequential data by processing it one element at a time, such as words in a sentence or time steps in a time series. The key feature of an RNN is its ability to maintain an internal state or "memory" that allows it to process sequences of varying lengths. This makes RNNs particularly useful for tasks such as language modeling, speech recognition, and time series analysis.

CNNs, on the other hand, are primarily used for image recognition and classification tasks. They use convolutional layers to extract features from images and pooling layers to reduce their size, allowing them to detect patterns at different scales. This makes them particularly useful for tasks such as object recognition, image segmentation, and natural language processing.

Overall, RNNs and CNNs are both powerful tools in the deep learning toolbox, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem being tackled.
